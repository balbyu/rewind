~~~~~ Ideas for Rewind ~~~~~~

First real attempt at creating some pleasing Website. I would like to incorporate a lot of inspiration
from very early websites manually using HTML/CSS. Later I will attempt to use some type of Framework to
improve the UI and make a cool mixture of retro / modern.

Phase 1 - Start with a serious index.html and style.css including GIFS, pictures, links, mailto, background
styling, unordered / ordered lists, basic CSS styling

1. Pure HTML (no CSS syling) landing page. This will have basic hyperlinks to other pages on the site, 
some type of mail-to, my own basic information (maybe Resume esq?)
2. 

Phase 2 - Make multiple pages, each with a different feeling / progression of web technology
